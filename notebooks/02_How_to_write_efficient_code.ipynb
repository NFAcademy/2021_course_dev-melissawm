    "There are two popular ways to flatten an array: .flatten() and .ravel(). The primary difference between the two is that the new array created using ravel() is actually a reference to the parent array (i.e., a “view”). This means that any changes to the new array will affect the parent array as well. Since ravel does not create a copy, it’s memory efficient."
